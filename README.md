# ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience: WTiCabs

## ðŸ“Œ My Role:
- Created presentations for strategic decision-making, client onboarding, and internal mobility reports.
- Worked on business models, EV-based sustainability strategies, and operational frameworks.
- Gained real-world exposure to cloud-driven logistics, compliance, and service delivery models.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Overview:

- `/certificates/` â€“ Internship verification or participation docs
- `/reports/` â€“ Optional insights, data charts, or surveys

## âœ¨ Why This Matters:

This experience shaped my communication, research, and technical documentation skills â€” all of which I aim to refine through a Masterâ€™s in Cloud Computing at SNU.
